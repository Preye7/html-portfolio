<h1>The Best Movies of All Time, According to Me</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>

<hr>

<h3>Lord of The Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>The best adventure movie, if you ask me. An accurate depiction of the novel as well.</p>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>This is a good contender, but LOTR takes the number 1 spot for me.</p>

<h3>Rush Hour</h3>
<p>So this isn't really in my top 3 movies, I kinda don't have. <br>
It's just there to complete the list.</p>
<span>I just can't think of any movies to include other than the first two.</span>
